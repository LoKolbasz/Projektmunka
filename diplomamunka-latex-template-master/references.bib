	shorttitle = {Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees},
	abstract = {We introduce the concept of a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree ({RRT}) as a randomized data structure that is designed for a broad class of path planning problems. While they share many of the beneficial properties of existing randomized planning techniques, {RRTs} are specifically designed to handle nonholonomic constraints (including dynamics) and high degrees of freedom. An {RRT} is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of {RRTs} are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied {RRTs} to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.},

abstract={Sischka discusses design considerations for novel high resolution and frame rate CMOS sensors. Lens and camera sensor technology tends to co-evolve. As cameras drive to smaller and smaller pixel sizes with growing formats, lenses need to he designed to match those higher capabilities. However, they evolve at vastly different rates from one another, with the advancement of sensor technology vastly outpacing that of optics. Commercially available cameras using CCD imaging sensors were only developed in the 1970s (by Kodak-Eastman), and at the time optics technology had been around for hundreds of years.},
